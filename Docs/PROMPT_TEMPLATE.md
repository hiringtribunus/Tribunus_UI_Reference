STRICT RULES TO FOLLOW:

Rule 1: Always run light tests which you later delete after testing success to ensure codebase stays clean.
Rule 2: Always implement code in a modular way that a junior engineer would be able to pick up. Use minimal and useful comments across code.
Rule 3: Do not dump or create summaries of tasks done in documents. The minimal in-line comments across code would be enough to see what has been implemented.
Rule 4: Make sure to plan well, think hard, then execute until the complete task is done.
Rule 5: Do not assume and try to get ahead of what the actual task is. Only perform the task at hand. You can read the FEATURE_LIST.md to understand and stay on the relevant current feature scope only.
Rule 6: Always read the code files AND the relevant .md files in full.
Rule 7: Stay on the TECH_STACK.md to keep the preferred tech stack which is vibe coding friendly.
Rule 8: For styling guide on UI experience, always refer STYLE_GUIDE.md
Rule 9: If the Feature is very strict on the directory structure, do not take it as that, have a overall holistic understanding of the entire project and make informed decisions instead of blindly copying the minor details in the Feature Spec.
